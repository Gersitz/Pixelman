# Pixelman in Godot

## What is this?
This is my first attempt to make my own 2D game using the Godot engine. So far, there is not much to see, but I'll keep this repository updated as I get further in development.

## What is this game about?
This game will eventually become a platformer with multiple different levels. Every level will be a single screen that consists of platforming and solving small puzzles. The level will be cleared once you collected every item and you will get a rating depending on how fast you were able to clear the level.

## What is planned?
To start, I want to create about 10 different levels. Once those are done, I have multiple different things I want to do:

- Create a Title Screen
- Create a Level Select
- Create a Settings Menu
- Add different characters
- Make different characters have slightly different movement behavior
- Make separate levels for each character

... and more.
